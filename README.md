The minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning is used in this artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game to guarantee optimal gameplay. You, the human, and the AI are the two participants in the game. By analyzing every move that may be made and selecting the optimal one using a depth-first search method that minimizes the potential loss, the AI aims to win. Because the game is created using an object-oriented, class-based methodology, the code is easily extensible and flexible. The class handles the game board, movements, and winner checks, offering an organized and effective method of controlling the game flow. The AI guarantees a competitive battle whether you play as X or O!
